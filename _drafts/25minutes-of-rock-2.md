And then the magic...

There are unfortunately a few caveats to using this effectively.

The largest drawback is the "Live Updating" option auto-refreshes the list at various intervals. This means that it won't play through 25m of a set of tracks, then stop and auto-refresh the next set of tracks. It will continually refresh the playlist after every track is played (and likely at other times too) which essentially gives you a never-ending playlist (as long as a track meets the criteria).

I didn't want this behavior. I want these playlists to act as a timebox. Therefore, I've found disabling Live Updating *will* cause them to work as intended. A 25 minute (approximate) set of tracks is found. You can press play (I usually trigger it with a keyboard shortcut), and it will play through that listing.

The downside is that after the music stops, you have to manually refresh the playlist if you want it to select a new set of random songs (and get rid of the previous set).

This isn't exactly *hard* by any means, and I found myself quickly adjusting to the ritual of pausing my work, taking a quick mental break, refreshing the playlist, and resuming work. It *would* be nice, however, if there were a setting that would play through the time limit set, pause the music, and automatically refresh the playlist (so that you could simply trigger play again with a fresh set of music).

The "Last Played" ...

The "Last Skipped" ...

## Apple Music

This interplays very well with Apple Music...you can add some additional rules if you want to filter out "local only" tracks or tracks that aren't part of Apple Music. But by default, with these rule sets, you'll be able to add anything into your library from Apple Music and it will appear in your playlists.

to do:

* explain my "unloved" smart list
* break into three articles:
  * smart playlists with Apple Music
  * smart playlists for timeboxing
  * smart playlists for unloved music
