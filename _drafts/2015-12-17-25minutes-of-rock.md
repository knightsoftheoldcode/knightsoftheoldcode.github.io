I'm an odd duck. In a single day I can transition between several phases of deep flow (dropping code like a bomb and tearing through feature requests) and skimming the surface of my task list (chasing nearly every shiny object on my screen like a kitten).

Over the years I've tried many different techniques for maintaing the state of flow and pushing all the distrations to the background. I've essentially refined my system into a little version of the Pomodoro technique but focused on 25m blocks of iTunes playlists.

And then the magic...

There are unfortunately a few caveats to using this effectively.

The largest drawback is the "Live Updating" option auto-refreshes the list at various intervals. This means that it won't play through 25m of a set of tracks, then stop and auto-refresh the next set of tracks. It will continually refresh the playlist after every track is played (and likely at other times too) which essentially gives you a never-ending playlist (as long as a track meets the criteria).

I didn't want this behavior. I want these playlists to act as a timebox. Therefore, I've found disabling Live Updating *will* cause them to work as intended. A 25 minute (approximate) set of tracks is found. You can press play (I usually trigger it with a keyboard shortcut), and it will play through that listing.

The downside is that after the music stops, you have to manually refresh the playlist if you want it to select a new set of random songs (and get rid of the previous set).

This isn't exactly *hard* by any means, and I found myself quickly adjusting to the ritual of pausing my work, taking a quick mental break, refreshing the playlist, and resuming work. It *would* be nice, however, if there were a setting that would play through the time limit set, pause the music, and automatically refresh the playlist (so that you could simply trigger play again with a fresh set of music).

## Apple Music

This interplays very well with Apple Music...you can add some additional rules if you want to filter out "local only" tracks or tracks that aren't part of Apple Music. But by default, with these rule sets, you'll be able to add anything into your library from Apple Music and it will appear in your playlists.

to do:

* explain my "unloved" smart list
* break into three articles:
  * smart playlists with Apple Music
  * smart playlists for timeboxing
  * smart playlists for unloved music
