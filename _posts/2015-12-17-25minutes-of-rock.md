I'm an odd duck. In a single day I can transition between several phases of deep flow (dropping code like a bomb, tearing through feature requests) and skimming the surface of my task list (chasing nearly every shiny object on my screen like a kitten).

Over the years I've tried many different techniques for maintaining the state of flow and pushing all the distractions to the background. I've essentially refined my system into a version of the Pomodoro technique focused on 25-minute blocks of iTunes playlists.

## Apple Music

Although strictly unnecessary, I find there are two core reasons why I *really* like the combination of using Apple Music with these playlists. I enjoy being able to arbitrarily add tracks, albums, or curated playlists to my music library. And I enjoy being able to "Love" songs.

Yes, I know how it sounds. But I've never been a big fan of the five degrees of celestial glory rating system. I like this song, but how much do I like it? If I were stranded on a desert island with this song, I wouldn't be offering to kill sharks with my bare hands for its returned affection... I guess I like it three stars worth. Bleh. I'm a programmer. I'm binary.

I'm fine liking, loving, favoriting, or otherwise indicating a simple on/off state expressing my undying devotion to a bit of digital information. Give me a thumbs-up, heart, star, bird, alien, syringe or whatever you want...but just give me *one* of them.

## Playlists

I'm aware of my ... eclectic ... taste in music. I'm a little bit Country, a little bit Rock 'n'n Roll (and a little bit Will Smith and Techno). But let's take the most socially-accepted playlist and go with it.

* iCloud Status is Apple Music
* Any of the following are true:
  * Genre contains Rock
  * Genre contains Heavy Metal
  * Genre contains Alternative
  
I find that even my rock tastes are pretty diverse. I'm going to blame that on the fact that the music industry can't seem to decide what "Rock" means. Regardless, the combination of the above rules does a pretty good job filtering my Apple Music Library to a listing of music that I like.

My wife recently made an observation she found humorous:

> I think it's funny that when you code you listen to screaming rock, and when you relax you listen to country.

I hadn't really considered it, but it's certainly true. I also listen to a *lot* of podcasts in my down-time. But when I'm coding I'm trying to establish [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). In order to establish flow I need three conditions: familiarity, stability, and creativity. I have loved rock music for decades, it helps establish familiarity. The musical scope and progression of rock is mechanically rhythmic, providing stability. And finally, rock just strikes the chords within my soul to open up emotional creativity (your mileage may vary).

There are a few more playlists related to genres (I'm sure you can spot them). There are a few maintenance related playlists which we'll discuss in a future article. The remaining two playlists are pretty simple: Loved and Unloved.

All of the above playlists are foundational building blocks for more complex playlists such as the timeboxing playlists. We'll cover these playlists in the next article.
